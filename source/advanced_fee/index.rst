Advanced Fee
============


Background
----------
An advanced fee scam is a scheme where a victim pays money with the
intention of receiving something, such as a vacation, cruise, loan,
or a stock investment, but then never receives anything of value
in return. These scams may be pretty obvious, or hidden deep inside a wordy
contract where a victim won't notice until after they sign. These
schemes are often very legal, and you can be targeted through a multiple
different ways. These avenues include through phone calls, emails, social
media, job boards of job ads, and fliers.

Examples of Common Scams
------------------------

A common example of an advanced fee scam is someone requiring
a finders fee for something, say an obscure loan. Then that con man
returns a financing source that will give the loan and gets paid
the finders fee. Afterwards, the victim is told they are ineligible
for the loan after all, and has been scammed the finder's fee.
Unfortunately, this scam is totally legal.

Another common example of an advanced fee scam is an add popping
up on your computer that says you won an all expenses paid vacation, all
you need to do is register to become a member of a
tourist/travel agency site. However, it costs to become a member
of the site, and when a victim pays to become a member, they
never hear back about their free vacation.
