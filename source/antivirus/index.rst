The Fake Anti-Virus
===================

Background
----------
Today, most computers come pre-installed with anti-virus protection to protect
individuals' private information and the safety of their computer. Examples
include the Windows OS system, which comes pre-installed with 
*Windows Defender*. Some individuals may take it a step forward and purchase an 
anti-virus program rather than use free services. However, how do you know if 
the anti-virus is reliable and trustworthy?

Overview
--------
Over time, scammers and identity thieves and hackers have developed new ways to
access someone's computer to gather private information. One examples of this
being the usage of fake anti-virus software. 

Rather than sell software that protects your system from harmful viruses,
this software infects their computer with dangerous programs; most commonly
random pop-up ads on your desktop. Eventually, a pop up will appear on their
system claiming to notice numerous viruses but need your credit card in order
to pay for the "subscription". [#f1]_ Along with asking for payment, after
downloading these rogue anti-virus softwares, you are giving the seller access
to your computer and your private information.


.. warning::
    Rogue anti-virus softwares often times alert you of viruses more often than
    your typical anti-virus software. Make sure to research anti-virus software
    before purchasing.
