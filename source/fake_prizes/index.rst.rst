get a hold of someones information. some informa
tion is fished if the reciever visited a sketchy
site and used their email adress.

a target for the fake prizes and sometimes they 
use the users last visit on the sketchy website 
to claim some trust.

the emails are also created by a generator that 
guesses random names and email combinations
twenty-four seven and sent to random people with such emails around the world.

The Information
---------------

within the email there a multiple key things 
that make these scams work. They sometimes have
their email wich was created to soung like the
company they are possing as. if it is walmart,
they email may a link to a walmart like page,
their phone number, a fake email, and more.

prize is which is usually a huge sum of money, 
gift cards, and even expensive jewlry or products
of the sorts. They keep the emails fairy short 
urging you to read it as people genarally do not
like reading long emails.

and lack of attantion to detal can cost a lot of
money to only recieve nothing in return. the email
usually doe not have legitimate domain names and 
can be as simple as 
(amazon.servic@gmail.com) this is a red flag 
because companies like amazon usually have the 
service after the (@) sign and they do not use 
gmail for their emails.

things to look out for also include is how you are
told you are going to earn your prize. the best 
situation is to avoid clicking the link in the

need to pay some fee to obtain your gift there is
a high chance that you are being scamed.
with online businesses it is easy to give up 
banking information expecially if the prize is large which it usually is.
by giving out that information they will obtain 
the information and steal money out of it, or they may get you adcted to spending by promming higher
and higher prizes for extra fees.
