get a hold of someone's information. Some information is fished if the receiver visited a sketchy site and used their email address.
in this was the scammers have your email to use as
a target for the fake prizes, and sometimes they use the user's last visit on the sketchy website to claim some trust.

the emails are also created by a generator that 
guesses random names and email combinations
twenty-four seven and sent to random people with
such emails around the world. [#f3]_

The Information
---------------

Within the email, multiple things make these scams work. They sometimes have their email, which was created to seem like the company they are posing as. If it is Walmart, their email may link to a page similar to the official Walmart page, phone number, a fake email, and more.

The email also contains information about the prize, usually a massive sum of money, gift cards, and even expensive jewelry or products of the sorts. They keep the emails fairy short, urging you to read them as people generally do not like reading long emails.

Red Flags
---------

with fake prizes, the red flags can look very legit 
and lack of attention to detail can cost a lot of money only to receive nothing in return. The email usually does not have legitimate domain names and can be as simple as (amazon.service@gmail.com); this is a red flag because companies like amazon typically have the service after the (@) sign, and they do not use Gmail for their emails.

Things to look out for also include how you are told you are going to get your prize. The best situation is to avoid clicking the link in the first place, but if you happen to click it and you need to pay some fee to obtain your gift, there is a high chance that you are being scammed. It is easy to give up banking information with online businesses, especially if the prize is large, which it usually is. By giving out that information, they will obtain the information and steal money out of it, or they may get you addicted to spending by promising higher and higher prizes for extra fees. [#f2]_
