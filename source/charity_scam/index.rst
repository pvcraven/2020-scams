Charity and Relief Internet Scam
=========

Background
----------

Charity fraud might be one of the most easiest ways a person
can get scammed on the internet, yet it is easily preventable.
Charity and Relief scams are schemes that seek donations of money
for organizations that say they do charity work. However, these
organizations do little, if not any, work that they say they will
do. One thinks they are giving money to an organization that says
they feed hungry kids, but end up giving money to criminals that
just keep the money instead. Often times these scams can arise
right after natural disasters or high-profile heart-breaking news
when people are in the giving mood.

.. note::
   With the Covid-19 Pandemic underway, watch out for charity scams tricking you with the disguise of donating to health care workers!



You can be targeted by Charity Fraud scams through multiple different
venues or technology. On the internet, these scams can target you
through your email by sending out mass emails or creating an email
chain. Crowd-funding sites and social media can also host many
charity fraud attempts. Another way of targeting you is through
your cell phone by sending you robo calls.

Real-Life Example
-------
In 2019, a South Carolina charity was caught by the FBI for a
charity scam. The charity "*Marines and Mickey*" was created
to send military families to Disney World, at least that's
what people thought. A former marine, John Shannon Simpson
actually created the charity to make himself rich. Being a
former marine gave John some credibility that he took
advantage of. Donors gave almost $500,000 to "Marines and Mickey"
and less that 20 percent of those funds actually went to use
helping military families. Most of the money went to John's bank
account. For more information about this scam, see the article
written by the `FBI`_.

How To Protect Yourself
-----------------------
**Here are some general tips to follow to make sure your money
doesn't end up in the hands of criminals:**

* Give to Charities that are established and who you trust.
* Watch out for Charities with copycat names.
* Do your research before giving out money! Such as checking out charity's website or doing a google search of them.
* Give money using a check or credit card. Charities requesting cash or virtual currency are big red flags.
