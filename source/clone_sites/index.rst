Clone Sites
===========

Clone sites, at first glance, look like the real site, but they are not. The scammers make a clone site that looks like the actual sites. The most common way the scam is conducted is by making fake websites that look reputable, such as clone banks, government tax websites, pension firms, passport sites, fake driving tests, travel companies, and fake retailers pretending to be reputable online retailers like eBay and Amazon. [#f1]_

How it works
------------

The clone sites have a problem getting people to click on their sites because they are a copy; however, they get people to connect by sending an email claiming an unknown activity on the victim's bank account. Then they provide a link for the victim to check to make sure everything is okay. The link then takes the victim to the cloned site. When the victim logs in, the scammers will have their banking information, which they can use to steal money. [#f3]_

precautions to take
-------------------

There are some ways and actions to minimize or limit the risk of reaching a cloned site. Make sure never to use an email link to visit your banks' site; if searching for a government site, there are things you can look for. The other important way to make sure you avoid such scams is to make sure all the links of websites you use are bookmarked and use them only, even when a link is provided in the email.
**Signs of a legitimate site**

* Begin with https (https://www.gov.uk)
* should see a padlock on the adress bar.

this applies to retailers as well, and if you do not
see these things on their site and another good thing
to do would be to limit purchases with 
businesses that you do not know well.

The goal
--------
The people behind these clone sites have many goals for creating these sites, although if the site is a bank, then their purpose is obvious. Clone sites are used for data harvesting, stealing credit card information, banking, and login credentials to outright theft. The clone cites can also profit from administrative or booking fees while still completing the victim's order. By completing the order but simultaneously scamming, the victim works in covering their tracks, but other scammer's steal without worrying about concealing their doings. Another goal is to fish for unlimited access to the victim's devices (phone, tablets, or computers), which they can track activities and seel the information or access save passwords. [#f4]_
