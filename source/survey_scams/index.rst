Survey Scams
============

Survey scams are one of the most common Internet scams you will come accross. They can come in email form or a pop-up, and are usually tailored to you based on your search history. For example, if you have been researching Apple products online, a survey scam may appear asking for your opinion on a product. 

The scammer's goal is to collect your answers from the survey and sell your data to big companies. Some survey scams may entice you with a gift card or a coupon of some sorts, but at best you will get nothing in return. At worst, they will infect your device with malware after taking the survey. 

.. warning::
    Sometimes, survey scams will ask you for payment information. This is a huge red flag!

*What are other signs to look for?*

There are real survey sites that will pay you to take surveys, but sometimes it can be hard to tell the difference between a legit survey and a scam. You should be highly skeptical if:

	* They post an ad on Craigslist
	* They offer **too much** money
	* They lack a **privacy policy**
	* They require an **unachievable minimum** before sending a check

There are survey sites that will promise to pay you one or two dollars for every survey you take, but before they'll ever send you your money, you must first accumulate an insanely high amount of earnings through all these surveys. This is done intentionally because they know that most people will never commit to taking that many surveys, so they will still get your data from the surveys you have taken without needing to send you a check.
